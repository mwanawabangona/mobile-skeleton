# mobile-version-skeleton
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)



The project is inspired by the figma microverse template 1 (https://figma.com/)
For this portfolio mobile skeleton website, I implemented HTML and CSS for this part of the template
and i also used Linters to fix bugs and other errors in both css and html.
